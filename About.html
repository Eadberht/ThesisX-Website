          <div class="AboutText">Higher learning is both time and place, but it is felt more as space. It is space where you go to prepare yourself for the beyond; it’s also simply a two years long space. Both lie within a larger structure — in this case, the world of design. At once you are between where you were and where you go. (Before) — After. These are the dichotomies that are at the crux of this year’s exhibition. This MFA year is in the liminal state of becoming something different. The same is true for the participants of the program, as they transition between pre- and post-. Their work is represented as within Pratt, within design, within today, but also between what is on either side of these things. And at the end, a period.
            <br/>Over the years, I have frequently heard exhibitions compared to films. Exhibitions frequently have a narrative component and are often organized to have a beginning, a middle, and an end that reveals an underlying story. I’m not sure I agree with this comparison. This process has been an arduous one. Each MFA candidate has presented a vision, offered an opinion, or provided a notion on how to organize and present this group of 18 designers in a coherent fashion. A solution slowly emerged out of the hours of presentations, collaborations, and negotiations. Is there a coherent narrative? I’m not sure. I think a better analogy to this exhibition is a book of poems by different authors. The exhibition will present a set of discreet ideas presented in unique voices. Some work will resonate deeply with the visitor and they will, hopefully, continue to reflect on what they have read, seen, and heard in the days and weeks that follow. (There is no end) —This is really just the beginning.</b>
