  <div class="footerText">Punctuation marks serve to clarify relationships between words and sentences, and symbols are representative of a material or object, especially one that is mmabstract. The creation of our ‘icons,’ or custom glyphs, function as punctuation marks that are specific and symbolic of something more abstract and hard to define (our personal theses). Thus, these ‘icons’ are transitional marks that are representative of very abstract connections between all of our work.</div>
