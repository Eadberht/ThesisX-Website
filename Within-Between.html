          <h1>Cyber-governance</h1>
          <p>
          Cyberspace is a medium in which computer-based human activities occur. The iteration of Information Communication Technology causes communications within cyberspace to become intrinsic to human behavioral patterns. Social activities in this medium shape social orders and power relations both online and offline. Hence, exercise of power within cyberspace creates typical power dynamics that not only affect online communities, but also shape the whole offline society. This transformation raises the important question, "What direction of social structure does the exercise of power within cyberspace lead us toward? A decentralized democracy or a centralized authority?"
          </p>
          <p>
          The unique power dynamic within cyberspace embodies a systemic exercise of power, mastered by certain power holders. A centralized social structure is created by propagating a "convenient" lifestyle that translates corporeal behaviors into interactions based on digital surveillance interactions and ubiquitous internet connections. Hence, interfaces are the actual form of exercised of power. Designers, as creators of interfaces, have the role of shaping various forms of power and social structures through their design decisions. Patterns and methodologies of communication design form the mechanism to exercise authoritarian power to create centralized authority in cyberspace, which I refer to as cyber-governance.

          <h1>Design for the Infra-Ordinary</h1>
          <p>
          My thesis focuses on the specific chunk of life that is labeled The Everyday. It is a study of the quotidian, banal, boring, ordinary, more so the infra-ordinary of everyday life, vis-à-vis design in terms of practice and consumption. I investigate the concept of infra-ordinary and the influence that contemporary designed environment has on our perception of it.
          </p>
          <p>
          Design, today more than ever, is present in our everyday, mostly as the facilitator of a high-speed, convenient life. We are getting surrounded by user-friendly—hard or soft—interfaces; exposed to countless trajectories of mediated data; and equipped with technologies to record, share, and deal with the banal particles of our everyday life. My question is how design can be a medium to rescue the infra-ordinary from the neglect and oblivion to which it is naturally consigned, without redesigning the Infra and transmuting it to extraordinary.

            <h1>Meta-Ethical Design</h1>
            <p>
            This paper is an invitation into my internal debate as I explore meta-ethical theories and design ideas to support the concept of the most ethical design being one that is both most useful and most pleasant to the user and designer. Design ought to create a solution that the user has a high expectation for. This high level of expectation for the user should be created by manipulating anticipation, fulfilling intrinsic prudential desires and continually surpassing expectations throughout the life of the solution, ultimately creating intrinsically pleasurable experiences for the user.
            </p>
            <p>
            There also has to be a high-level expectation from the designer established by positioning that expectation in a preferable speculative future. Through speculative consideration, the solution should continue to surpass the designer’s established expectation while the designer fulfills his or her considered intrinsic desires. It should also push forward the field of design by investigating and defining the affordances and behaviors of a medium through the application of the solution.
            </p>
            <p>
            Finally the interaction ought to help the user obtain their life goals by maximizing what the interaction enhances, minimizing the created vulnerabilities, and also minimizing the areas of the user’s life aspirations that are suppressed.

          <h1>Designing for Autotelic Interactions</h1>
          <p>
          Interfaces, the points between humans and technology, should be in favor of creating optimal experiences, otherwise known as flow. The creation of new technologies, particularly within the digital medium, expose users to boundless amounts of information that are not necessarily in line with their personal goals and above their current skill level. New technology naturally challenges many of the conventions we live by and this can cause anxiety in our interactions with it. Through the remediation of existing frameworks, the interfaces we design can allow for experiences that request the deep attention of individual users. The familiar yet new interactions these interfaces create can allow the transition of existing skill sets to new technologies in a seemingly transparent way. Working within a set of clear and simple rules a user can engage with media at their own skill level to prevent feelings of boredom or anxiety.
          </p>
          <p>
          Designing by borrowing existing frameworks of past mediums can allow users to become more autotelic in their interactions, to spend their psyche energy in a manner that allows for the utmost absorption of knowledge. In other words, to communicate in a more meaningful way.

          <h1>Closing the Gap</h1>
          <p>
          The current American prison crisis is societally topical and ripe for investigation. But what is design’s role in the matter? While exhaustively studied by criminologists, psychologists, policy makers, lawyers, and even architects, designers have worked very little in the field. What can designers do and create in either the traditional communications design fields or the broader systems and transformation design fields?
          </p>
          <p>
          Systemic problems are both incredibly challenging to solve and hugely impactful on society at large. Design projects, ideated through research that involves those most affected by the system in question, can be used to give this population voice and bear witness to their position. These projects, whether communicative of current realities or speculative of the future of the prison system, should use prisoners’ incarceration experiences as their research backbone to bring harsh realities to public light and even serve as a consultancy tool for decision makers debating changes and reforms.

          Power dynamics can be altered, despite the prevalence of systemic dominance, by uniting individuals with common concerns and desires. For my thesis, I will use design activism to address race and law enforcement, to demonstrate the ability of design and art to create collective power, and to foster a space for contestation and dialogue.
          </p>
          <p>
          The perceived gulf between government and United States residents is not innocuous. The strength of our democracy influences the quality of our public services and civilization. One of my goals with this thesis is to investigate ways to change rhetoric and affect attitudes about government, and reframe questions of criminal justice as it relates to race. To understand democracy, it is important to investigate ways to spur public engagement. A great way to achieve that is enhancing participation and conversation on social issues through design.
          </p>
          <p>
          Design activism, an emerging topic of interest and research, places design as a central focus to analyze basic societal and civic problems. In a broad context, design activism is about using the power of visual communication to make beneficial change in the world.

          <h1>The Future Backwards</h1>
          <p>
          The future as a source of knowledge is an emergent and promising idea. In design, future thinking can be of great utility because it provides unlimited perspectives of a problem. The future can act as a versatile design language that allows for the emergence of different forms of communication and function as a multi-design process of inquiry. Most importantly, the future can be an ideal space for designers to be critical of their status quo. My work consists in the exploration of the possibilities of future thinking as a critical tool. I will not speculate on future scenarios as a purpose, but to envision alternative realities where we are forced to question our present logic. In a period of significant change, designing futures can offer a wider perspective on life, an awareness of the process and evolution of things, and provide a reflective analysis of where we stand, not only as designers but also as human beings.

          <h1>Emergence</h1>
          <p>
          Emergence is a term used to describe how low-level units aggregate to achieve high levels of complexity. At its core, Emergence is concerned with nature’s performance, analyzing the systems that produce form, and celebrating the relationship between energy and material. </p>
          <p>
          Creating form through an Emergent design process is exciting because it often begins with the analysis of microscopy images that reveal new worlds to the human eye. Microscopy also opens the door to collaborations between designers and scientists—an age-old love affair made better through the opportunity to co-create dynamic visual material.
          </p>
          <p>
          My thesis explores the genesis of three-dimensional form to consider how structures that are inspired by microscopy can serve as a model for creating not only efficient, but also provocative results. Through an exploration of form created by architects and sculptors influenced by the tenets of Emergence, my thesis uncovers the potential for artistic creativity in forging structures that borrow from worlds that the naked eye cannot see, and in so doing, push at the boundaries of design.

            <h1>Knowledge in the Age of Information</h1>
            <p>
            My thesis began as a series of investigations into the quality and character of the information that we consume online from reference sites such as Wikipedia. Contemporary information technology operates within a complex, global community, wherein transfers of information are structured in many different ways. Designers construct and define these exchanges through the creation of information systems. These systems tell a story in the way that they capture and make accessible the ideas, conversations, and interactions of a group of people over time.  
            </p>
            <p>
            This thesis explores a typology of knowledge that can be applied to improve the quality of information systems as well as how we globally access and contribute to them through various media. Designers must differentiate between information and knowledge, which are constructed and embodied differently. Information is transmitted to us primarily by way of external messengers and received in static form. Conversely, knowledge is an internalized, more thorough understanding of that information. Knowledge is refined over time and results from the thoughtful integration of information with our own experience and culture. Knowledge informs our role within a society and shapes more meaningful connections to the world than through the transmission of information alone.

          <h1>New Authenticity: The Same, Only Different</h1>
          <p>
          To decipher the notion of authenticity is perhaps better described as an attempt to decode an ambiguous and oftentimes, paradoxical puzzle. Despite its rather archaic and pervasive associations, the word itself persists in our vocabularies despite the absence of any clear criteria for measuring or defining it. While the concept itself has been one of the most critical and debated subjects in literary and cultural studies over time, the boundaries between being "authentic" and "inauthentic" remain nebulous and uncertain, if not porous.
          </p>
          <p>
          This thesis will take a closer look at how contemporary cultures continue to view authenticity and its potentiality, while favoring the realization of a different kind of authentic reality as it relates to the field of design––one that is based on the understanding that every innovation results from a new interpretation or contextualization of an existing cultural attitude or action. This shift in perspective, I argue, will provide a more expansive appreciation of contemporary modes of production in terms of their limits and potentials and bring into focus the unrealistic ideal of authenticity while suggesting design not as an endpoint, but rather a simple moment in an infinite chain of contributions.

          <h1>Subject to Change: An Inquiry into Metamodernism and (Graphic) Design</h1>
          <p>
          This thesis seeks to translate and synthesize select themes of the Metamodern cultural paradigm in order to apply them as an approach to design problems and processes. Building off the obscurities resulting from Postmodern relativism and dialectics, Metamodernism uses a reconstructive approach towards contemporary cultural issues by co-occupying a structuralist attitude, while the difficulties in doing so. The result of this approach is the embodiment of an era characterized by proto-synthesis—the proliferation of a new engagement in various disciplines which embraces contradictions.
          </p>
          <p>
          We are now in the age of the prototype. The finished product is less important than the longevity of the idea. Cultural evolution takes place in a series of steps from case study to case study. Through gathering and analyzing a collection of examples that live in the Metamodern cultural paradigm, this thesis alternatively suggests an inquiry into cultural studies as an approach to the general practice of design.

          <h1>Wait, What?: Towards Universal Understanding</h1>
          <p>
          Civilizations depend upon the effective communication of knowledge among people. Throughout history, advances in technology have lead to significant changes in communication. Unfortunately, these changes often result in a disconnect between groups of people who are at different stages of technological literacy. This disconnect hampers the effective transmission of knowledge. This thesis defines and characterizes elements of a linguistic model which can be used to gain an understanding of distortions in communication. In turn, this understanding may foster means to remediate and remove obstacles or, at a minimum, engender empathy of groups towards one another.

          <h1>Weighing Lightness: An Analytical Lens</h1>
          <p>
          Lightness is something we can intuitively feel when we encounter, but what the term signifies might be elusive. The conceptual and philosophical implications of lightness go beyond the general definition of the physical absence of weight. The concept is full of subtleties and nuances that can hardly have a direct definition. However, we can still ask what are the influential parameters of lightness?
          </p>
          <p>
          As the dichotomy of lightness and heaviness has been discussed in various disciplines such as philosophy, literature, visual art, architecture, and product design, this research aims to explore the meaning of lightness in communication design. By applying methods of literature review, ethnography research, cultural probes, and grounded theory, this thesis investigates and reinterprets the influential properties of the opposing concepts of lightness and heaviness from a perspective of communication design. The result presents an analytic system as a tool to analyze design and other aesthetic phenomena in an attempt to explain this rather elusive concept and reveal the underlying rationale of lightness.

          <h1>From A to B: An ethnographic exploration of oscillating intention in interactive design</h1>
          <p>
          Lack of intention drives interactive design. However, what happens when we change our goals mid-way through? In interactions between organic and digital realms, which are more common now than ever, such interruptions between establishing a goal, and then acting on it, are increasingly likely. </p>
          <p>
          This thesis uses theories on human behavior and philosophy to examine why a user’s intentions oscillate before and during a designed interaction, particularly interactions between organic subjects as mediated through digital means. The paper focuses particularly on navigational design, and employs ethnographic research to interrogate how established tools and methodologies affect user behavior. Three realms of the interaction are analyzed: the temporal context of engagement; the user’s perception of her own identity as it relates to her peers; and the user’s relationship with her exterior environment. Within each of these realms, the paper examines specifically how, when engaged with an experience, navigational designs appeal to and/or challenge users’ desires for control, familiarity, and mutability.

          <h1>Design Exclusivity: On Free and Open Source Software and Design</h1>
          <p>
          Free Software and Open Source Software (F/OSS) will change the design industry’s concepts of collaboration and credit, its relationship to remuneration and reuse, while also creating a more innovative, cooperative, and prosocial design community. The freedoms guaranteed by F/OSS encourage innovation and reciprocity by promoting modification and improving ROI by reducing wasted duplication of effort. These freedoms also drive ownership and democratize distribution by obsoleting proprietary systems and silos. Businesses continue to adopt F/OSS, encouraging Design to learn from the cultural impact Free Software has had on software development, and to adopt those patterns to their own methodologies. By doing this, Design will be able to break the dependency on proprietary software like Adobe’s Creative Suite which has become so entrenched and omnipresent. Because of the importance of good design elements in the adoption of software, designers more than ever will be able to directly influence the future of software.

          <h1>Nature Inspired Methodology</h1>
          <p>
          By the year 2050, the human population will have doubled but our natural resources will not. This thesis observes an imbalance in urban habitat management. The uneven growth of a suburb into an urban city raises questions regarding the use and loss of natural elements in our environment, and how this affects people. The scope of environmental aesthetics includes many definitions of the physical and spiritual phenomena of open space and organic matter, called "nature" in this thesis. How does the loss of space and nature transform the human condition of everyday life for a resident of this town? How can design reflect the concept of entropy as found in nature, as both loss and transformation? This thesis opens a dialogue for these concepts to create new routes for design communication.
          </p>
          <p>
          The outside space refers to the physical lines of architectural presence, the space that all people move in and around. The inner space is the ephemeral, the spiritual and the organic, which has fueled the creative spirit since the dawn of man. The loss of open reflective space that nature provides may bring disorder and entropy to the human condition.

            My thesis shows how humor can adjust communication to enter people’s brains. Its purpose is to show how humor can disarm and open up minds to new information. It proves that humor can create interest, which then facilitates the reception and comprehension of information, and can be integrated into design from the beginning of its process.

            <p>
            Through exploration, I have discovered the concept of honest surprises. The unexpected ending that, through a given precedence of what to expect, you then receive something else entirely. This lets Brian make the connection. It is like when you are walking across your yard and you step on a rake and get smacked in the head, of course with a lot more reasoning and targeting toward a communications goal. With explorations like these, I have walked out of this with fewer brain cells, but more importantly, with a knowledge of how to communicate more effectively.

          <h1>Developing a Snapshot of Design Education</h1>
          <p>
          Design education is and has been changing on a global level for the past thirty years. The original established form of design education was to teach people how to design. Many of the exercises and projects that students do while in design school are to teach them the process of completing projects they will be required to complete in the professional field. This thesis is an exploration of the influences currently changing design education. By looking at research and studies related to design education, I have identified three main influences as being the most influential: technological advancement as tools and language, globalization and the millennial generation gap, and the current unstable global economy considering current educational hiring practices. In order to understand how these influences are changing design education, we must first identify what the current design pedagogies are and how these are being affected by such influences. These projects explore new methods of learning through design, while working to understand current teaching practices.

  <p>As the position of design in contemporary society becomes increasingly multi-dimensional, the designer is left to clarify their own parameters. The collection of thesis investigations presented in this year’s exhibition follow no underlying theme, other than what lies in the transitions—within and between designers’ research topics; within and between the gallery and the outside world; within and between the individual designer and a larger public; and within and between an MFA program and the continuation of a design practice.</p>
